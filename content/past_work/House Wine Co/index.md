The idea here was to help celebrate a new wine brand from Henry of Pelham that could be enjoyed casually, with friends.  

I received the assets from the bottle labels as well as the bottle measurements and got to work.  Everything on screen here is animated, including the bottles at the top of the ad.  

A product render is often easier and less expensive than practical photography, and this project was proof-positive of this.  That, taken with the fact that you can do literally anything with the rendered imagery, just strengthens the case for renders.  But I digress.  

Here I had the opportunity to play with mixed frame-rates which you can see in the side-scrolling 2D animation portion of the ad.  When some elements are moving smoothly, but others are moving in a more choppy way, it creates a visual texture that can be quite lovely.
