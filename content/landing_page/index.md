Hey friends! I'm Will. I'm an Emmy winning animator, VFX artist, digital video specialist, creative problem solver, husband and dad.  I have 15 years of experience working in television.  You can read more about that in the Bio and Past Work sections.  

But while you're here, why not check out this ... well, it's not a demo reel.  Really, it's not.  I know the clips are covered in timecodes and studio watermarks and some of them are just "viewport renders" but it really isn't a demo reel. This reel is designed to be enjoyable to watch whereas industry reels kinda ... aren't.

Now, if you're inclined to be curious as to whether I know how to time a performance with an audio track, here's a perfectly lovely industry-facing demo reel for your edification:

I'll say though, to my industry colleagues, that anyone who's worked with me knows that the real value I bring goes way beyond demo reels and performances.  I bring compassionate leadership, proactive problem solving, clear communication, a rare growth mindset and unparalleled energy. I bring fun, and approachability.  I get curious about challenges instead of jumping to conclusions.  

I address roadblocks with my unusually active brain, but I lead with my heart.
