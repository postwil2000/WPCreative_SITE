Really, it's not a demo reel. Demo reels are typically pretty dull and weird and meant for folks who want to see whether the mouths are moving in time with the voice-over. At least, industry reels are. They're meant as a way of saying, "Really, I can do this stuff, believe me!" as if putting some footage on a video is proof of anything.

What I'm saying with this video is, "Hey, check out some of the cool stuff I made in the last 15 years. I'm excited about it and if I can, I'd like to get you excited about it too!" That's it. Enjoy!
