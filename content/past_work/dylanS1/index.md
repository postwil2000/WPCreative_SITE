I had a full circle experience with this show.  I was on the proof-of-concept team, which was more of an R&D team to be honest.  There, I had the distinction of being the animator who was said to have "cracked" the style of the show.  

Later on, when Blues Clues was wrapping up, I rejoined the effort to get Dylan's myriad technical issues sorted out.  I was given near complete latitude and I did not disappoint.  I managed to make it possible to execute the show's critical "Ribbon Effect" branding moment.  

My involvement in the show was an unmitigated success.  I managed to clear a 3 month backlog in a matter of weeks.  I built a suite of tools for the revisions team.  I wrote documentation and identified and described segments in the show for improved communication and standard-setting purposes.  I overhauled the note-taking process for revisions.  The list goes on.
