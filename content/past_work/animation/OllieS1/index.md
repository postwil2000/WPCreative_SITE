This show was a different kind of experience.  We used a mix of hi-res food photography and 2.5D animation in 3DS Max.  I won't say too much about it except that it was another hi-volume show for the small number of senior animators on the team.  I once again took on a mentoring role on the team, coaching and training juniors so they could get the most out of their work.  

I actually look back fondly on those desk-side crouching sessions.
