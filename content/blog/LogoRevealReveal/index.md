Ok, so this is long overdue.  But I’ve been a little busy, which is a good problem to have.  

I’m on a bit of a journey.  For 15 years, I’ve been making other people’s work.  I’ve been happy to do it and I hope to do it again some time.  But for a little while now, many of those people haven’t been making work, so I’ve been going out into the world to find my own bits and pieces of work.  I’ve largely been doing this on my own but I’ve also had some help from friends.  I’ve also made some original work which, I think, went really well.  

As it turns out, one of the ingredients for finding bits and pieces of work is branding.  So here’s some of that.  It’s a logo-reveal of my own.  I’ve done a few of these now for some other folks and I’ve done a few of these for some other business concepts I’ve toyed with for myself.  But this  “Will Postma Creative” or “WP Creative” or whatever it winds up being - this thing that has my actual name and identity on it - seems to be sticking.  So here goes.  Let’s call this a reveal.  A logo-reveal … reveal.  

I’ll be sticking this (or some variation of this) to the front or back of all my original material going forward.  And yes, I have more original material in the works.  Stay tuned …
