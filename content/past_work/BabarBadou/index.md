This was my first experience doing a higher level of animation.  We had time to hone our shots on this show, and I learned to take my time and stick my performances.  This show was also largely in the round, not on a flat stage like so many preschool shows tend to be.  It presented no shortage of interesting challenges and I think the final product was quite nice.
