Here .... I took on something that was perhaps ill-advised.  Oh, it was fun, and I think it turned out well.  I received a ton of positive feedback for it.  Its the timeline.  Yes, the timeline was a little foolish.  

To release a video-a-day for 12 days is one thing.  I'm used to working on a strict, regimented schedule.  The issue here was that the idea for this project came in late November ... mere weeks before the first - and last - video would have been due for release.
