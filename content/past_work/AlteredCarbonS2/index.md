I took on all kinds of things on this show.  Sure, there were a LOT of muzzle flashes.  I made a microphone explode when it was impacted by a ... a bullet?  Its the future.  Whatever they have for bullets in the future.  

The big thing I did on this show, from concept to execution, were interfaces and holograms. These generally started as 2D or 3D animations that had to be constructed, rendered and then composited just right so that they sit well within Altered Carbon's colourful, neon dystopia.
