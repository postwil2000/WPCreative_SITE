Blueâ€™s Clues and You won the 2025 Emmy in the category of Outstanding Preschool Series!  

This one felt pretty good.  The episode we sent out for consideration was one that I had the privelidge of being the Lead Animator on. That meant that the work that the Academy considered and decided to award was largely my own, alongside work from a stellar team that I worked for years to mentor and provide resources to.  

For the couple years leading up to this point, I put a LOT of energy into to elevating Blues Clues and You in terms of quality and consistency.  To me, Blues Clues is a tentpole preschool show.  It's iconic and special and it deserves to be treated with care.  

I created a process for dramatically improving the musical sequences, I helped to completely overhaul the animation library, and I produced and distributed improved documentation to the team.  I also identified a small handful of superstar animators who had been itching to do higher level work and I empowered them to show the team what they were made of.  

It was a journey getting to this point and it was a huge team effort.  I'm grateful to have been a part of it!
