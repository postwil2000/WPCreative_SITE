Back in December of 2024, I did a series of mini-films for the 12 Days of Christmas.  They’re short animated vignettes, each one or two minutes long.  

Here's the link to the first video:

You can find the rest from there.

They’re silly, but they don’t know they’re silly.  Everything is played totally straight except the gags.  I was attempting a stop-motion, claymation look which, I think, was fairly successful.

The timeline was perhaps a little foolish.  To release a video-a-day for 12 days is not a huge problem so long as you give yourself a long running start.  I'm used to working on a strict, regimented schedule.  The issue here was that the idea for this project came in late November ... mere weeks before the first - and even the last - video would have been due for release.  A wiser me might have shelved the whole thing for the following year.  A wiser me I am apparently not.  

This project was a crunch the whole way through.  Smart planning, a furious hyper-focus and providence saw me through, but it was close at times.  

It was well received.  It boosted the reach on my instagram account tenfold and it taught me a great deal about what people actually want to see on their feeds.  It’s not a surprise.  They want fun.
