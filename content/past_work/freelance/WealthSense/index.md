The client wanted to jazz up their new site with some fancy vignettes in gold.  That included an animated logo and some cute characters gently illustrating the concepts discussed throughout the site.

I worked with the client to create a number of adorable characters and vignettes.  All of them are 3D animated, rendered and optimized for web.  With the videos created, I worked with the client's web team to ensure they interacted well with user's exploration of the site.
