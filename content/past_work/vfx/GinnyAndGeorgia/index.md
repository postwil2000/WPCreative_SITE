This is one of those non-vfx VFX shows.  Plate-cleanup is how a compositor pays their dues.  They take the footage and they clean it up.  It's slow, careful work and its excellent training.  It can be thankless though, because if you've done your job properly, nobody will ever know you were there. 

It's often about fixing errors that occur during filming, but it's also more than that.  There are so many things that are just easier to do in post, whether you need a background changed or adjusted, a story beat to be played out just right on a phone screen, or you need an actor's thumbnails to be un-painted.  Post work is nearly always less expensive than re-shoots.
