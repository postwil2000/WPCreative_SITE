It's a real treat, working on a show you look forward to watching yourself.  

For this show, I tackled set extensions, animated CG inserts, holograms, screen inserts, plate cleanup, you name it.  I can kinda do it all, so they put me on whatever needed doing.  I'd assist other artists with their work as well, whether to lend fresh eyes on a complex puzzle or simply to keep things moving.
