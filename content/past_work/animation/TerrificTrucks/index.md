After my success on Bibleman, I was given Terrific Trucks to lead all on my own.  My first Lead gig and I was going to be doing it solo.  Hoooo boy.  I needed to design a workflow that would accomodate a constantly changing team, with animators coming and going to and from other projects.  The show wasn't complicated from an animation perspective, but it was exacting, and I was never going to have the typical amount of time to train people. 

I managed to find the right balance between documentation and automation, allowing the artists to feel confident enough to hop onto the project for a day, then hop back onto another project with minimal ramp-up time.  In the end, our team's handling of the show received universal acclaim.
