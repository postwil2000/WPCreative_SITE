Dylan's Playtime Adventures holds a special place in my heart.  To start, I was on the proof-of-concept team where I had the distinction of being the animator who finally "cracked" the style of the show.  My real contribution came over a year later however.  

The show was having some major technical challenges, some known, many as-yet unidentified.  I was brought on to help rescue this show by finally figuring out how to make their big branding moment - the Ribbon effect - possible.  I created a process to make this effect orders of magnitude easier.  Then, I trained a small team of artists on how to use the new process effectively and together we were able to clear their 4 month backlog all in about 8 weeks.  I then moved on to identifying and addressing a dozen other technical and process issues, many of which could just as easily tanked the show.  

We're talking improved note-taking processes, specialized software tools, better communication methods within and across teams, the identification of standard segments in the show and their documentation, 

Suffice it to say, I took a show that wasn't going to go to air - seriously - and got things running so smoothly that weekly review sessions actually became fun!
