It's a real treat, working on a show you look forward to watching yourself.  

For season 4, I paid my dues as a newer compositor by doing dozens and dozens of screen composites and holograms.  I learned a tonne.  My comps rendered fast, were organized and they looked great.  It was on this show that I started building my personal VFX shot-submission check-list.  I'll write a blog post about it some time.
