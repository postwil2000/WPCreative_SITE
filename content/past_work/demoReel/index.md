Here's my technical studio reel from 2024. If it seems a little disjointed or boring, it's because its meant for folks in the animation industry who're looking to see more of what's under the hood.  

If you're looking for something that's actually fun to watch, head over to the [12 Days's of Christmas](https://willpostma.com/special_projects/12daysofchristmas/) videos I did back in December of 2024.
