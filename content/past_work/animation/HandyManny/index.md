My second TV show as an animator was Handy Manny.  My lead on this show (shout out to Steve Corbett) took me aside and showed me, step by step, how to get a great performance out of a character.  Here I learned the importance of demystifying the process of making something complex when you're teaching someone who's new.  I learned that behind all magic, there are sets of techniques that just need to be employed in the right ways.  As a mentor, you're not there to impress your mentee, you're there to pull back and curtain and give them the power to surpass you.  

I carry that lesson with me to this day.
