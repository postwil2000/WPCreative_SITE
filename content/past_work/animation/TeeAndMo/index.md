This was another 2.5D 3DS Max show.  The rigs we had here were really something else.  I was on a small team of senior posing artists who's job it was to get all the initial posing and timing nailed down so that the junior team could go through our files and do cleanup and polishing work.  It was something we tried for a couple shows.  

This system has historically been used in classical animation.  A pro to this system was that juniors got a chance to work on shots that had been started by senior artists.  There's value to that.  It's part of how I eventually learned compositing so quickly.  A big con to this method, however, was that nobody ever really felt as though their shot was truly theirs.  Still, it was a good experience.
