If you don't already know, I'm Will. I'm an Emmy winning animator, VFX artist, digital video specialist, creative problem solver, husband and dad.

I have 15 years of experience working in television.  You can read more about that in the Bio and Past Work sections.  

But while you're here, why not check out this ... well, it's not a demo reel.

Really, it's not a demo reel.  Demo reels are typically pretty dull and weird and meant for folks who want to see whether the mouths are moving in time with the voice-over.  At least, industry reels are.  They're meant as a way of saying, "Really, I can do this stuff, believe me!" as if putting some footage on a video is proof of anything.  

What I'm saying with this video is, "Hey, check out some of the cool stuff I made in the last 15 years.  I'm excited about it and if I can, I'd like to get you excited about it too!"  That's it.  Enjoy!
