This show wasn't thought of as a VFX show, but many VFX shows aren't.  In this case, most of what we had to do involved compositing stills of the New York City skyline (the show is filmed in Toronto) out the windows of their office building.  There was also some fun work with a CG bowling ball and an interesting shot where the director preferred two different performances from two different takes, one on the left half of the screen, another on the right.... so those had to be stitched together.
