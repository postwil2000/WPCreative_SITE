Sometimes you have to be reminded why you love doing a thing.  Sure, it’s nice - and super necessary - to get paid for your work.  But also, the doing of the work should be its own reward.  

This is a special section of the site and it’s going to be dedicated to a special category of work. Here's where I'll be sharing projects I'm doing for myself and for you.  It’s a place where I can post work that's not client work, but work that shows a little more of who I am and what makes me smile.  Call it personal work.  

Much of it will be cross-posted elsewhere like instagram, youtube, but this will be the catch-all so it’s easy for you to find stuff later on.  

Enjoy!
