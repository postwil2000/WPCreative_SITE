This show was largely done with practical effects, but there was one sequence in Season 6 that was handled with a series of CG inserts.  The infamous movie premier in front of the Schitt's Creek Town Hall.  The crows they released from the box in celebration of Moira's new movie were animated by a colleague and myself, and composited into the shot by me.  

Such a goofy episode.  I love that show.
